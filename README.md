iPhone HTML5 Offline App Demo
====

Try it now on the [**Live Demo**](http://coolaj86.info/iphone-html5-offline-app-demo)


Please post any mistakes or notes you have on the issues page (or fork me) and I'll add the necessary information.

Apple calls these "Web Clips" (online) or "Offline Applications" (offline).

    git clone git://github.com/coolaj86/iphone-html5-offline-app-demo.git
    cd iphone-html5-offline-app-demo

**Node.JS server**

You can use any web server. I'm not doing anything special with `node` here.

You just have to make sure that `main.appcache` loads with the mime-type `text/cach-manifest`

    npm install spark
    spark

Putting an Offline App on the Home Screen
----

Let's assume the ip address of your server is `192.168.1.100` running on port `3080`.

You'll visit `http://192.168.1.100:3080` and choose one of the apps and then add it to the **Home Screen** as follows:

**iPhone**

  0. Click `[->]` icon in Safari
  0. Select "Add to Home Screen"

**Android**

  0. visit http://192.168.1.100:3080
  0. Click `menu`
  0. Click `Bookmarks`
  0. Click `Add`
  0. Exit to Home Screen
  0. Click and Hold in empty space
  0. Select `Shortcut`
  0. Select `Bookmark`
  0. Click the app
  0. Shoot yourself... users will never be able to figure out all of these steps - I can barely do it!

Note: It might be useful to store all assets which will be available offline in a folder called "assets" and write a script to walk the directory and produce the cache manifest (always with the current datestamp) including those assets. This will save you a lot of headache.

Cache Manifest
----
call this `main.appcache`. DO NOT call it `cache.manifest` (works in Chrome, not on iPhone)

    CACHE MANIFEST
    # That must be the very first line
    # comments must be on their own line

    # version 0.0.1
    # bump the version any time you edit ANY of the CACHE assets
    # otherwise they won't get updated when the app comes back online
    
    CACHE:
    # list ALL assets which should be downloaded for offline use
    # no pattern matching is supported
    /offline-assets/offline.html
    /offline-assets/libs.js
    /offline-assets/app.js
    /offline-assets/logo.png
    /offline-assets/style.css

    FALLBACK:
    # give the offline equivalent of a 404
    # the first item is always treated as a prefix pattern
    # the second is always treated as the resource to provide
    /pages/ /offline-assets/offline.html
    / /offline.html

    NETWORK:
    # list any assets which are allowed to be fetched 
    # from an online source even after the caching is complete
    # can use * or prefix pattern matching
    /online-assets/
    http://www.google.com/api/search

Fun fact: You don't have to use `\r\n` in the Cache Manifest. `\r` and `\n` are also okay.

Notes
====

**Heachache Alert**: `Cannot Open MyApp MyApp could not be opened because it could not connect to the server.`

With one mistake of the `main.appcache` you may end up in an error loop that you can't get out of without clearing the cache and renaming the app.

Solution:

  * Clear Mobile Safari's cache. `Settings => Safari => Clear Cache`
  * Rename your app `<title>AppName</title>`
  * You might also try renaming your URL. I.E. http://example.com/path/to/app to http://example.com/path/to/app2

How to avoid:

  * Test on Chrome until your app works, then on test your iPod / iPhone / iPad.
  * Particularly, always test your `main.appcach` in Chrome first. 

**Other Notes**:

  * Develop on **Chrome first** - which has useful error messages - then test on Mobile Safari
  * The cache manifest may not be named `cache.manifest`. `main.appcache` works fine.
  * If there is an error in your cache manifest, your app will not update
    * you delete a file that was listed
    * you list a new file that doesn't exist
  * The cache manifest is NOT checked by modification date. It is checked bit-for-bit
  * The cache size is limited to 5mb
